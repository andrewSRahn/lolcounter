You can't do your ult trought his ult.], Tip [id=383, votes=27, champion=Azir, tip=Whenever Azir uses his Q to move his soldiers in lane, just float around it and get in his face to harass him, early on his Q CD is 7-9 seconds so you will have plenty of time to abuse that downtime before he can move his soldiers to counter attack.], Tip [id=384, votes=31, champion=Azir, tip=High mobility is the counter to Azir, if a champion can move around quickly Azir cannot keep his soldiers on them and they can move to safe zones while fighting him.

Stay back and farm. Poking him with your Q is not a great idÃ© cuse of this soldiers. Wait till 6 and "all in" him with your Q+E+W+R+Q combo. The lane will slowly become yours.], Tip [id=389, votes=46, champion=Azir, tip=Fizz can you use his E to escape from Azir's solders and from range from then, if fizz is post lvl 6 he will prob go all in on Azir.], Tip [id=390, votes=52, champion=Azir, tip=Ziggs's Q outranges azir so take advantage of this and harras with your Q.You'll win in lane], Tip [id=391, votes=62, champion=Azir, tip=Your satchel charge jump will not get you over Azir's wall so don't try!], Tip [id=392, votes=67, champion=Azir, tip=Annie's E returns damage dealt by the sand-soldiers.

If you send your Soldiers after him, he can easily dodge them by teleing to his Shadows.], Tip [id=394, votes=89, champion=Azir, tip=Pre-6, Azir will bully lane pretty hard.

Mobility counters Azir.], Tip [id=395, votes=92, champion=Azir, tip=Whenever he moves a soldier towards you in lane, just use a shadow and jump on him.

If he's dashing into a dangerous situation, you can assume he's about to ult.], Tip [id=398, votes=269, champion=Azir, tip=Do not fight Azir/his team around a destroyed tower base. Engage once his tower's health is REALLY low, or when it dissipates. It only stays up for 1 minute, and has a 3 minute cooldown.], Tip [id=399, votes=414, champion=Azir, tip=Azir's E has a generally long cooldown. If he has dashed recently, take advantage of his escape being down. Be careful if he turns around on you. His shield gives a lot more protection than you think.], Tip [id=400, votes=864, champion=Azir, tip=Azirs are forced to start with their W first. At level 1, their soldiers are very immobile, and so is Azir. At level 2, he'll probably take his Q. He shouldn't have escapes until level 3. Get an early gank to try to snowball lane.]]

Your attack speed makes up for that. Don't use your E until you know his escapes are on cooldown. You can output your damage faster. Diana should win, as her kit is just better.], Tip [id=1090, votes=54, champion=Fizz, tip=Pre level 6 you can poke him anytime you feel like it. Your passive blocks his Q and with your dashes you can dodge his E and stay out of his AA range.

When he stuns you, immediately use QSS and then continue attacking him.], Tip [id=1510, votes=14, champion=Jax, tip=Keep wave just outside your tower, and only trade by using E on minions then knocking up Jax and immediately backing off.

Early levels 1-4 try harass him with Auto+Q when he goes in for cs.], Tip [id=1511, votes=15, champion=Jax, tip=From level 4 to 11 you are able to win trades. Once you have your sheen you will be able to almost one-shot a minion.

During the Game Jax gets better and better, try to take him out as early as possible and ward!!], Tip [id=1516, votes=23, champion=Jax, tip=While Aatrox usually relies on his great sustain to stay in lane, Jax can constantly harass him. Instead, maxing your E (Blades of Torrent) abuses the fact that Jax can't heal and zones him far enough away to maintain lane control and poke him down.], Tip [id=1517, votes=24, champion=Jax, tip=It is absolutely crucial that you do not push until you have at least the items for a sunfire cape and finished merc treads. If he can get a jungler gank, you will die.

Also freeze the lane near your tower so your jungler can gank.], Tip [id=1526, votes=39, champion=Jax, tip=Jax will usually use his e before jumping on you. So whenever you see him using e in lane, try to get out of range], Tip [id=1527, votes=40, champion=Jax, tip=His E (Counter Strike) ability will negate all of your basic attack damage, which includes your Q. Try to bait the ability out beforehand and attack after he has finished with the ability.], Tip [id=1528, votes=46, champion=Jax, tip=His E cannot dodge your Q and E. Jax relies a lot on his counter strike to dodge the damage he recieves. Garen is extremely tanky for Jax and your early damage is huge. Do not let him roam or farm, or he'll be a problem late game. Use W when trading.], Tip [id=1529, votes=47, champion=Jax, tip=Engage near the bushes, and when jax starts using his spin, E into the bush to negate the stun and/or Q(jump) followup from jax, re-engage if going for the kill since his stun has a long cooldown], Tip [id=1530, votes=49, champion=Jax, tip=Wait until his baton twirl is done.

He'll eventually outscale you but you have the early game advantage so roam more and build offense first (Hydra + Triforce) build tanky after], Tip [id=1544, votes=155, champion=Jax, tip=When jax turns on his e, root him with your w immediately. This way, he cant jump and his stun would go to waste], Tip [id=1545, votes=164, champion=Jax, tip=Force Jax to engage within Nasus's Spirit Fire whenever possible to maximize damage output from Siphoning Strike and nearby friendly creep.], Tip [id=1546, votes=175, champion=Jax, tip=When Jax starts Counterstrike and jumps in, press W to reduce the damage and stun time, and E to punish him for jumping within range of you. Follow with Q after you stop spinning to land another massive damage blow on him.], Tip [id=1547, votes=262, champion=Jax, tip=Maxing your Tempest first will minimize Jax's damage since he relies on Auto-attacks. When he uses Counter-Strike, Safeguard to a minion to avoid the stun and damage, then Sonic Wave back to maximize your damage against him.], Tip [id=1548, votes=467, champion=Jax, tip=Jax can outtrade you at level 1 with counterstrike. At pretty much every point after that you're stronger. You outwaveclear, outdamage and outsustain him. Build an advantage pre-11 or you will get outscaled.], Tip [id=1549, votes=774, champion=Jax, tip=In order for you to beat Jax in lane as Malphite, you'll need to slowly poke him.

(Diamond Ryze Main)], Tip [id=2472, votes=30, champion=Nasus, tip=Many people usually have trouble with this match up as it's usually very hard to zone Nasus as Shen.

If you manage to poke her with Q before reaching lvl 6 and not take too much damage, then immediately engage on her the moment you have your ult. Her shield can save her but your damage is higher.], Tip [id=2624, votes=27, champion=Orianna, tip=As akali - even when snowballing - don't grow arrogant and dive an orianna. She has a backup shield and can keep you under turret for a long time with her ult.

At 6 don't go on her unless you hit a charm, save your ultimate if she tries to escape and to dodge her skillshots.], Tip [id=2626, votes=42, champion=Orianna, tip=You'll struggle to kill a good ori until you hit 6.

First max e so you will be mobile enough to make some good trades.], Tip [id=2629, votes=47, champion=Orianna, tip=If she takes E first and she protects herself just turn away and focus on CS. She is weakest when she misses her Q or her ball shield is down. Play safe.], Tip [id=2630, votes=48, champion=Orianna, tip=When you are both full HP, don't get close to Ori as she has a more reliable form of trading than you and her autoattack passive will win her the extended fights. Stick to harassing with max range Q's and going in after you have poke her down enough.], Tip [id=2631, votes=51, champion=Orianna, tip=Take note of Orianna's summoners, they will vary from Heal/Ignite/Barrier, you should plan your approach accordingly to avoid getting baited by Barrier or underestimating her damage with Ignite.], Tip [id=2632, votes=53, champion=Orianna, tip=When orianna uses her e in lane on herself, you have a four second window to trade after the shield fades. Orianna really needs the shield to trade positively. The best time to all in her is at that point.], Tip [id=2633, votes=56, champion=Orianna, tip=Practice reflexive use of Ziggs' Satchel Charge for when Orianna attempts to toss The Ball into his path. The ability to successfully dodge the initial burst of both Orianna's ult and a follow-up slow is life-saving.], Tip [id=2634, votes=60, champion=Orianna, tip=Try to harass the orianna with your Q when she's about to go for a last hit on a creep. At the same time, you must pay attention to her ball positioning so you don't get harassed back. After level 5, you naturally out damage her so this is an easy lane.], Tip [id=2635, votes=61, champion=Orianna, tip=Orianna has limited mobility but very good wave clear, she will most likely push your lane, leaving her vulnerable to ganks. Taking a mid-laner with CC will make ganks much more effective.], Tip [id=2636, votes=81, champion=Orianna, tip=LeBlanc has a lot of burst from level 2 with a simple Q+W and she is very mobile so you can bully Orianna out of lane and dodge her abilities with ease. At level 6 you can one-shot her with your full combo.], Tip [id=2637, votes=98, champion=Orianna, tip=Keep your distance, both of you work in a similar way with long range harass castable while moving but your harass is stronger BUT if you get too close Orianna's autoattacks will sway the trade in her favour.], Tip [id=2638, votes=99, champion=Orianna, tip=Play safe and farm until six. Then you'll have more burst potential with your Ult.], Tip [id=2639, votes=107, champion=Orianna, tip=Stagger your ultimates in duels, keeping a cool head and specifically using your jumps to dodge her ball and ultimate are what will keep you alive in duels.], Tip [id=2640, votes=151, champion=Orianna, tip=Ori can't zone him from farm because of his great ranged waveclear. If she ults him he can dodge it with W or with his own ult. Zed can also Death Mark her, R to the shadow when she ults, and W back onto her.], Tip [id=2641, votes=756, champion=Orianna, tip=Orianna's ball, when on the field, has most mobility moving from side to side, as she can move it with less range requirement. to avoid being hit by the ball so much, try staying behind it (ball in front of you). this way she must come closer to hit you.], Tip [id=2642, votes=821, champion=Orianna, tip=Although both Orianna's auto attacks and spells do massive damage, she is very fragile.

Report], Tip [id=2644, votes=1136, champion=Orianna, tip=Try not to stand next to her ball, because she can cast Dissonance and do damage around it. Report]]

2018-09-02 14:21:20 [INFO ] Application#40: [Tip [id=3047, votes=-16, champion=Shen, tip=You need to build a little bit of MR (Magic Resist) to counter his ''Q'' and his passive.], Tip [id=3048, votes=-6, champion=Shen, tip=Shen is very good at farming passively with a frozen lane, but not good at pushing. If you keep lane constantly pushed to turret he can't ult anywhere. He will also lose CS to turret easily as his Q has slightly too long CD], Tip [id=3049, votes=-4, champion=Shen, tip=Shen has among the better sustains in lane, only beaten by champions like Vladimir and Nunu etc. Trying to get kills on a good Shen is difficult, so instead push lane and roam to mid. He has low wave clear and his ult has long CD. Punish other lanes.], Tip [id=3050, votes=-3, champion=Shen, tip=Every time Shen taunts your adc, just swallow him and shield him. Easy laning phase for both you and your adc. Follow his ult with your ult. Your kit just counters him straight up], Tip [id=3051, votes=-1, champion=Shen, tip=Not sure about this, but pretty sure Shen can just ult on the side-bar where his teammates appear], Tip [id=3052, votes=1, champion=Shen, tip=Your Q does more damage the higher health your target has, which Shen fits.], Tip [id=3053, votes=2, champion=Shen, tip=Reworked Poppy only. If you think Shen is about to dash into you, immediately activate your W. Shen's dash is a good opening for his jungler to gank you and you'll be safer. Plus you can trade with him favourly if he wastes it.], Tip [id=3054, votes=3, champion=Shen, tip=Shen cant Ult a target he has no sight of. Take advantage with your ult in teamfights by focussing a sqishy carry and take him out, before vision debuff ends], Tip [id=3055, votes=5, champion=Shen, tip=You can disrupt a shen taunt before he gets to the target. Use a knockup or other hard cc mid taunt and he wont reach his target.], Tip [id=3056, votes=7, champion=Shen, tip=It's usually more beneficial to use Ignite on Shen near the beginning of an all-in so he can't heal from him Vorpal Blade, rather than using it near the end to try and secure the kill. His shield will usually keep Ignite from actually killing him.], Tip [id=3057, votes=8, champion=Shen, tip=Vorpal Blade is slightly longer than Decimate. Use the brush to avoid Shen's poke, and Decimate as he tries to farm. Try not to Decimate his shield. If he starts his ult, break the channel with Apprehend.], Tip [id=3058, votes=20, champion=Shen, tip=Abuse your range advantage. Shadow Dash won't reduce the damage from Hyper's passive.], Tip [id=3059, votes=21, champion=Shen, tip=Vlad's ranged harass and sustain is far superior to Shen's. Just don't get predictable and get taunted, and you'll have no problems.], Tip [id=3060, votes=26, champion=Shen, tip=when shen is using his ult, use your ult to stop him], Tip [id=3061, votes=30, champion=Shen, tip=Shen cannot stop Nasus from farming without junglers help. However as Shen, you should use your ult for max global presence and thus try end the game before Nasus gets 600 stacks.], Tip [id=3062, votes=31, champion=Shen, tip=Constantly pressure; don't let him sustain with Vorpals. He can't 1v1 you, but you can't stop his ult, so take his tower if he ever leaves.], Tip [id=3063, votes=32, champion=Shen, tip=When you see him teleporting, damage him as much as possible. This way he'll be less useful when he actually gets there.], Tip [id=3064, votes=35, champion=Shen, tip=BEWARE OF SHEN'S MINIONS EARLY GAME. Shen's taunt can be deadly when used on you to force you to attack him inside his minion wave. Minion aggro can and will be used against you by a good Shen if you are playing overly aggressive.], Tip [id=3065, votes=50, champion=Shen, tip=When Shen casts his ultimate, immediately use your Q. That will put his ult on its huge cooldown and avoids Shen to enter in teamfights.], Tip [id=3066, votes=53, champion=Shen, tip=Shen's threat is very low until he gets his dash. You should be able to auto him hard, but be wary when he turns as that probably means that the jungler is right there as well.], Tip [id=3067, votes=77, champion=Shen, tip=Use the brushes to avoid taking Vorpal harass every time it's up. Focus on farming as he can break your engage with his dash and you won't have time to stop his ult. At 6 he can't fight you because your Grandmaster passive pierces his taunt debuff.], Tip [id=3068, votes=428, champion=Shen, tip=Do NOT attempt to hit his turret or him when he's under his turret(Even when he's low), he is most likely baiting you into a taunt, shield, flash(and possibly ignite), Vorpal combo. (Does not apply so much to Tryndamere, his ult is OP)], Tip [id=3069, votes=452, champion=Shen, tip=Try to juke Shen's taunt. This will give him a harder time to stick onto his targets. Report], Tip [id=3070, votes=523, champion=Shen, tip=If playing against a Shen after level 6, always be cautious of fighting because the Shen will make a 1v1 become a 1v2, or 2v2 become a 2v3. Report], Tip [id=3071, votes=652, champion=Shen, tip=Shen can be interrupted while channeling his ultimate, preventing him to teleport to his ally. Try laning against him with a champion with a disable. Report]]

Try to keep track of her. Punish every counter-jungling by her with a gank, or a helping team mate, as she has no escapes till lvl 6. As the game progresses, you will scale better than her and become very resistant.], Tip [id=3076, votes=-1, champion=Shyvana, tip=Shyvana can be more strong than Zed because she is more tanky. at the start vs Zed u should be playing safty but at the late game u can beat Zed easly.], Tip [id=3077, votes=0, champion=Shyvana, tip=Gangplank's W is typically used to clear Crowd Control, rather than to heal him. Since Shyvana doesn't really have any Crowd Control effects, your chances of damaging and killing him are more effective than the reverse.], Tip [id=3078, votes=1, champion=Shyvana, tip=A different thing you could do is try to harass as much as possible to make her either go back and lose farm, or if she is below 1/4 health you might be able to kill her(nothing above 1/4!). Beware though, never go under tower against a Shyvana.], Tip [id=3079, votes=2, champion=Shyvana, tip=Lee can safely place wards deep in Shyv JG, keep constant vision and bully her as often as possible. she has no gap closers pre 6 so that's your window.], Tip [id=3080, votes=3, champion=Shyvana, tip=Beware the circle of death. She will chase you down and kill you with it, dont fight when its up or being used. Save your E to get away if she engages on you (after level 4 or 5). Pre 4 you outdamage her as long as her circle of death is down.

Follow the combo Qx 3 into W and then E to dash out. This mostly give a good trade. Repeat this until lvl6 and poke her down until you can all in.], Tip [id=3083, votes=8, champion=Shyvana, tip=Always kite Shyvana with your auto-attacks and Glitterlance when you are not last-hitting. If Shyvana uses Burnout, use Whimsy on yourself and back-off. If Shyvana ults, ult yourself and Glitterlance her. GOOD TIP: Build Wit's End and atk-speed items.], Tip [id=3084, votes=11, champion=Shyvana, tip=Good Shyvana can't be kicked out from lane easily, but she's isn't able to kick out from a lane, her E just do almost 0 damage if she not get close to you.

Shyv doesn't have the burst damage to break through.], Tip [id=3092, votes=222, champion=Shyvana, tip=Jax is stronger level 1 because of counterstrike dodging autos and being a stun. But Shyvana becomes stronger from about level 4-11. Go as even as possible. Getting Botrk first makes the 1v1 easier, but triforce is better when completed for burst/ms/hp.], Tip [id=3093, votes=229, champion=Shyvana, tip=Champions that can slow Shyvana or speed up themselves and either kite or outdamage her while her Burnout is not active are great picks against Shyvana. Examples of such champions are Kha'Zix, Aatrox, Kennen, Swain, Lulu, and Kayle.], Tip [id=3094, votes=233, champion=Shyvana, tip=Most Shyvanas should get Botrk first in a Trundle matchup since Trundle's ult just steals resistances. So your first items should probably be Botrk, Ninja Tabi (to help with auto attacks) and negatron (Shyvana is 60% magic damage).], Tip [id=3095, votes=235, champion=Shyvana, tip=Ulting after Shyvana ults will help you steal even more resistances.

Singed will push to your tower so try to set up ganks.], Tip [id=3104, votes=-1, champion=Singed, tip=Singed has issues facing magic damage top lane opponents as he has few inexpensive magic resist choices during laning phase to choose from.

Singed cant handle the damage since he is a health tank.], Tip [id=3106, votes=1, champion=Singed, tip=Vayne top is arguably the harshest counterpick to Singed.

Simply prevent his proxy and you beat him at all points of the game], Tip [id=3107, votes=2, champion=Singed, tip=Try to do damage in bursts, then fall back with your shield. Best way to win lane is early game.

She has 3 and you have 2, you should keep your second one and try to save it for her third dash.], Tip [id=114, votes=320, champion=Ahri, tip=When you land a Q and decide to follow it up, use E ASAP to prevent Ahri from immediately Charming you.

Q itself does little damage, when she consumes the mark with aa she does a lot.], Tip [id=157, votes=28, champion=Akali, tip=Akali will win most melee trades, stay in safe range or lock her down.
